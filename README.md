# automated-stock-trading
Here, I have implemented a regression based stock trading algorithm that is capable of trading stocks via the the Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation (TWS) platform. 

It contains a template for running the code through the PyNTS Library to manage trades and make calls to and from the TWS Platform. It is a private library developed by NeuralTechSoft Pvt. Ltd.
The code represents a sample implementation of it. 

# To run the backtesting code locally, follow these steps

1. ```git clone https://github.com/AryaStark13/automated-stock-trading.git```

2. ```pip install requirements.txt```

3. ```python main.py```

Make sure the latest stocks are downloaded via the Data folder containing codes to download as well as preprocess the stock data.
